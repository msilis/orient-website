# Orient Watch clone website

HyperionDev Web Development Bootcamp project. Clone a site using React and functional componentes.

Please note: this is super non-responsive. This is one of those 'it works fine on my machine' kind of things. This was put together on a 1920x1080 display and should look fine if you look at it on one of the same size.

If I had all the time in the world and didn't have two little kids running around here, I'd probably fix all the size issues.
